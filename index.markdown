# About

The UBC/SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is jointly hosted by the graduate students of the [UBC Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) and the [SFU Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html). The Spring 2023 event is the second of two events taking place in the 2022/2023 academic year. The Fall 2022 event was organized by graduate students from SFU, and the Spring 2023 event is organized by graduate students from UBC. Over its 18-year history, the event has offered Statistics and Actuarial Science graduate and undergraduate students at both schools an opportunity to network with their peers and to attend accessible talks about the research work of their fellow students and faculty. 

The Spring 2023 event includes talks given by six students (three from UBC and three from SFU) and one faculty member from UBC.

<p><strong>A Monte Carlo EM Analysis of COVID-19 Outbreaks in Long-Term Healthcare Facilities</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We analyze a dataset of daily case counts from COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities across BC, Canada. We treat infection durations as missing data and apply the EM algorithm to estimate the probability of transmission and mean infection duration, as well as a third parameter governing the effectiveness of outbreak management.

We use the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm to approximate difficult conditional expectations with Monte Carlo integrals. Importance sampling is used to generate the necessary Monte Carlo samples. We propose a novel stopping rule for the MCEM algorithm based on a well-known relationship between the score vectors of the observed and complete data models.</p>

<p><strong>Random survival forests: which methods work best and under what conditions?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There have been few systematic comparisons of how best to build survival trees and forests. An important question to answer in the literature is as follows: What are the best methods for constructing forests using survival data, as evaluated by a predefined metric of error? Our investigation systematically investigates various factors – forest construction method, censoring, sample size, the distributions of the response and predictor variables, and the presence of confounding or noisy predictors – that influence survival forest performance via an extensive simulation study. We find that all these factors, as well as many of their interactions, have significant effects on estimating survival functions and predicting survival times. We make recommendations for which methods to use depending on the data settings one is dealing with.</p>
